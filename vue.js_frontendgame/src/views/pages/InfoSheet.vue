        <p>You will be invited to use the game I have made and do a quiz before and after you've played the 
            game. Your results will be recorded during the experiment. You will be able to communicate with 
            the experimenter during the experiment if you need to do so. If you are uncomfortable or have a 
            problem, it is possible to take a break or stop the experiment altogether at any time. Once the 
            study is completed, you will be debriefed, and may ask any questions about the study or the 
            procedure.
