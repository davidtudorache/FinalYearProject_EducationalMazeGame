# FinalYearProject_EducationalMazeGame
For my final year project, I designed and developed a web application that was designed to educate people on JavaScript, in the form of a maze game that players could navigate using JavaScript code. It also contained an authentication system that would allow users to store their scores, a testing system that could track user progress and a high score system that would allow for friendly competition between players. This web application utilised basic JavaScript and HTML for the game, Vue.js framework for the frontend of the website and Node.js library for the backend ô€‚± with an SQL database being accessed from that backend.
